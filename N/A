You're right, the error persists because the core issue isn't in the payout code itself, but in the **state of the data** in your Firestore database.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **The Error:** The error message "Mismatch: Sum of confirmed transactions (₹0.00) does not match available balance (₹2000.00)" tells us exactly what's wrong:
    *   Your `userProfile` document in Firestore has a `cashbackBalance` of ₹2000.00.
    *   The code on the payout page queries the `transactions` collection for all documents belonging to this user that have `status: 'confirmed'` and haven't been paid out (`payoutId: null`).
    *   The query finds **zero** such transactions (hence the sum is ₹0.00).
    *   The code correctly identifies this discrepancy and throws the error because the available balance should theoretically equal the sum of unpaid confirmed transactions.

2.  **The Root Cause:** As you pointed out, **there are no transactions in the database**, or at least no *confirmed* transactions linked to this user that haven't already been paid out.

**Why are there no transactions?**

This application, as currently built primarily on the frontend, lacks the crucial **backend logic** to:

*   **Track Affiliate Sales:** Automatically fetch data from affiliate networks about completed purchases made through your links.
*   **Create Pending Transactions:** When an affiliate sale is reported, create a corresponding transaction document in Firestore with `status: 'pending'`.
*   **Confirm Transactions:** After the retailer's return period ends (e.g., 30-60 days), update the transaction status from `'pending'` to `'confirmed'` in Firestore. This step would also update the user's `pendingCashback` and `cashbackBalance` fields in their `userProfile`.

**How to Proceed (Since I Cannot Implement Backend Logic):**

Since I cannot build the necessary backend infrastructure (like Firebase Functions) to automatically manage transactions, here's how you can test the payout flow and address the current state:

1.  **Manually Create a Transaction:** The most direct way to test the payout is to simulate the state where a user *has* confirmed cashback.
    *   Go to the **Admin Panel -> Transactions** page (`/admin/transactions`).
    *   Click "**Add New Transaction**".
    *   **Find the User:** Search for the user by email (the one with the ₹2000 balance). Select the user.
    *   **Fill in Details:**
        *   Select a Store.
        *   Enter a **Sale Amount**.
        *   Enter the **Cashback Amount** (e.g., 2000).
        *   Set the **Status** to **`confirmed`**.
        *   Select a **Transaction Date**.
    *   **Submit:** Add the transaction. This will create the transaction document *and* update the user's `cashbackBalance` (and `lifetimeCashback`) because the status is set directly to `confirmed`.
2.  **Retry Payout:** Now, log in as that user and go back to the `/dashboard/payout` page. The mismatch error should be gone because the `sumOfTransactions` query will now find the confirmed transaction(s) you manually added, and the sum should match the `cashbackBalance`.

**In Summary:**

The payout code is correctly identifying a data inconsistency. The fix isn't in the payout page code itself but requires either:

*   **Building the backend logic** to automatically create and confirm transactions (the long-term solution).
*   **Manually creating 'confirmed' transactions** via the admin panel for testing purposes.

No code changes are needed for this specific error, as the problem lies in the missing data in your database.
