        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

        <p>
          Welcome to CashEase! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the CashEase website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the "Service"), operated by [Your Company Name] ("CashEase", "we", "us", or "our").
        </p>
        <p>
          Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old [or the age of majority in your jurisdiction] to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>
          To access certain features of the Service, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for any activities or actions under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Cashback Service</h2>
        <p>
          CashEase provides a service that allows registered users to earn cashback on purchases made at participating retailer websites ("Partner Retailers") after clicking through affiliate links provided on our Service.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tracking:</strong> To earn cashback, you must be logged into your CashEase account, click on a designated affiliate link for a Partner Retailer on our Service, and complete a qualifying purchase on the Partner Retailer's website within the same browsing session. Using other coupon codes, browser extensions, or clicking other links may interfere with tracking and invalidate your cashback eligibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cashback Rates:</strong> Cashback rates are set by CashEase and Partner Retailers and are subject to change without notice. We endeavor to keep rates updated, but discrepancies may occur. Cashback is typically calculated on the net purchase amount (excluding taxes, fees, shipping, gift-wrapping, discounts, or credits). Specific exclusions may apply depending on the Partner Retailer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confirmation:</strong> Cashback initially tracks as "Pending" and is subject to confirmation by the Partner Retailer after their return/cancellation period expires. This process can take 10-60 days or longer. CashEase is not responsible for delays or non-confirmation by Partner Retailers. Cashback may be cancelled if the order is returned, cancelled, or fails to meet the offer terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for accuracy, CashEase is not responsible for tracking failures due to technical issues, user error (e.g., disabled cookies, clicking other links), or actions by Partner Retailers or affiliate networks. We will investigate missing cashback claims in good faith but cannot guarantee cashback recovery.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Payouts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Threshold:</strong> You can request a payout once your "Confirmed" cashback balance reaches the minimum threshold specified on the Service (e.g., â‚¹250).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Methods:</strong> Payout methods (e.g., bank transfer, gift cards) are subject to availability and may have associated processing times or fees (which will be disclosed).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accuracy of Details:</strong> You are responsible for providing accurate payment details. CashEase is not liable for payouts sent to incorrect accounts due to user error.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account Closure:</strong> We reserve the right to close accounts that are inactive or suspected of fraudulent activity. Unclaimed cashback in closed accounts may be forfeited.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>

          <li>To attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other user accounts.</li>
